This is a Google Chrome extension developed to click automatically the "Skip Ad" button by querying it every 100 milliseconds using the setInterval() function.
This allows the code to check if the "Skip Ad" button exists and click it before the countdown timer reaches 0 (this is very fast you almost cannot see when an add was started.)
setInterval() is a JavaScript function that executes a function or code snippet at a specified interval (in milliseconds). 
In this case, the function queries the "Skip Ad" button every 100 milliseconds and clicks it, if it is found.
Please beware that this automation may not be in accordance to the YouTube terms of service and your account can be banned, however my account is still not suspended.
There is also a commented code in the content.js file which will automatically click the button after the interval reaches zero which should be in accordance with the YouTube terms of service,
you can use it instead of the other one.
Enjoy! :)
